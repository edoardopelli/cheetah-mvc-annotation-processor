# cheetah-mvc-annotation-processor
Annotation processor for creating Controller-Service-Repository classes

Create your Entity classes, the create an interface and annotate it with @CheetahSpring annotation.
You have to specify 3 attributes: 

entity (qualified name)
httprest (the REST service path)
pkgroot (under which package you want your classes)

That's all.
